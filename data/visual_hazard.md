=========================================

### HAZARDS FOR ACNE (PIMPLES/BOILS)
- INGREDIENT: Isopropyl Myristate / Isopropyl Palmitate
  - HAZARD: Highly comedogenic (pore-clogging). Can turn a small pimple into a deep cyst.
- INGREDIENT: Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera)
  - HAZARD: Extremely heavy lipid that traps bacteria inside pores. 
- INGREDIENT: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)
  - HAZARD: Known to cause "follicular irritation," which can trigger new breakouts.

### HAZARDS FOR ECZEMA (ATOPIC DERMATITIS)
- INGREDIENT: Denatured Alcohol / Ethanol / SD Alcohol
  - HAZARD: Strips the moisture barrier instantly. Causes "flare-ups," stinging, and extreme dryness.
- INGREDIENT: Fragrance / Parfum / Linalool / Limonene
  - HAZARD: The #1 trigger for eczema-related allergic reactions. Causes redness and intense itching.
- INGREDIENT: Essential Oils (Lavender, Peppermint, Citrus)
  - HAZARD: Though "natural," these are highly volatile and often cause burning on compromised eczema skin.

### HAZARDS FOR HIVES & CONTACT DERMATITIS
- INGREDIENT: Methylisothiazolinone (Preservative)
  - HAZARD: A common "contact allergen." If detected, it is likely the cause of the user's hives or rash.
- INGREDIENT: Oxybenzone (Chemical Sunscreen)
  - HAZARD: Frequently causes "photo-allergic" reactions where the skin breaks into hives when exposed to sun.
- INGREDIENT: Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM Hydantoin)
  - HAZARD: High-risk trigger for localized swelling and itchy red welts.

### HAZARDS FOR CHICKENPOX
- INGREDIENT: Salicylic Acid / Glycolic Acid (Exfoliants)
  - HAZARD: Can cause chemical burns on open chickenpox blisters. 
- INGREDIENT: Retinol / Vitamin A
  - HAZARD: Too aggressive for viral lesions. Increases the risk of permanent scarring (pitting).
