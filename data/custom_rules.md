DERMATOLOGICAL AI ASSISTANT - CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE

GLOBAL RULE 0: If the user describes severe symptoms (fever, difficulty breathing, spreading red streaks, intense pain, or symptoms lasting more than a few weeks), ALWAYS advise them to seek immediate in-person medical attention from a licensed dermatologist or emergency room.

### CONDITION 1: ACNE LOCATION MAPPING (LOCALIZED BREAKOUTS)

#### ZONE: FOREHEAD & HAIRLINE
- SYMPTOMS: Small red bumps (papules) or whiteheads concentrated along the upper forehead and hairline. May feel rough or "clogged" rather than painful.
- CAUSE: Often "Pomade Acne" caused by hair products clogging the pores or sweat/friction from hats.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Use a Salicylic Acid cleanser along the hairline. Switch to "Non-Comedogenic" hair products.
- LIFESTYLE & ROUTINE TO AVOID: Avoid wearing hats for long periods. Avoid letting hair styling products touch the forehead skin.

#### ZONE: CHEEKS
- SYMPTOMS: Inflamed breakouts, redness, or pustules appearing on the mid-to-lower cheek area. Often occurs on one side more than the other.
- CAUSE: Bacterial transfer from phone screens, unwashed pillowcases, or touching the face.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Clean phone screens daily. Change pillowcases every 3-5 days. Wash makeup brushes weekly.
- LIFESTYLE & ROUTINE TO AVOID: Avoid resting your face in your hands. Avoid sleeping on the same side of a pillow for more than two nights.

#### ZONE: JAWLINE & CHIN
- SYMPTOMS: Deep, painful, "under-the-skin" cystic lumps that don't always come to a head. Often flares up during high stress or menstrual cycles.
- CAUSE: Linked to hormonal fluctuations (androgens) and oil gland overstimulation.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Use Benzoyl Peroxide. Consult a professional for hormonal therapy if persistent.
- FOODS TO AVOID: Reduce dairy and high-sugar foods.
- LIFESTYLE & ROUTINE TO AVOID: Avoid excessive stress and poor sleep.

#### ZONE: BACK & CHEST (TRUNCAL ACNE)
- SYMPTOMS: Widespread red bumps, blackheads, or painful cysts on the back, shoulders, or chest. Often itchy when sweating.
- CAUSE: Sweat and dead skin cells trapped by tight, non-breathable clothing (Acne Mechanica).
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Use a Benzoyl Peroxide body wash; leave on for 2 minutes before rinsing. 
- LIFESTYLE & ROUTINE TO AVOID: Do not stay in sweaty workout clothes. Avoid tight synthetic fabrics.

### CONDITION 2: ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA)
- SYMPTOMS: Intense itching (pruritus), dry/scaly skin, red to brownish-gray patches, and small raised bumps that may leak fluid when scratched.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Apply thick, fragrance-free emollients (ointments) after bathing. Use 1% hydrocortisone for redness.
- FOODS TO AVOID: Highly processed foods, artificial dyes, or personal triggers like dairy/soy.
- LIFESTYLE TO AVOID: Avoid extreme temperature changes and low humidity.
- ROUTINE TO AVOID: Do not take long, hot showers. Avoid harsh, scented soaps and itchy fabrics like wool.

### CONDITION 3: URTICARIA (HIVES)
- SYMPTOMS: Raised, itchy welts (wheals) that are skin-colored or red. They can change shape, move around, and disappear/reappear quickly. They turn white when pressed (blanching).
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Take oral antihistamines (Cetirizine/Loratadine). Apply a cool compress.
- FOODS TO AVOID: Common allergens like shellfish, nuts, eggs, or foods with heavy preservatives.
- LIFESTYLE TO AVOID: Avoid excessive heat, sweat, and intense physical exertion.
- ROUTINE TO AVOID: Avoid tight clothing and scratching, which triggers more histamine release.

### CONDITION 4: FURUNCLES (BOILS)
- SYMPTOMS: Starts as a hard, painful, red lump that grows larger. Becomes filled with pus, develops a yellow/white "head," and may throb with pain.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Apply warm, moist compresses for 10-15 mins several times a day. Wash with antibacterial soap.
- FOODS TO AVOID: High-sugar diets (which can weaken the immune response to bacteria).
- LIFESTYLE TO AVOID: Do not share personal items like towels or razors.
- ROUTINE TO AVOID: NEVER squeeze or lance a boil at home; this can cause the infection to enter the bloodstream.

### CONDITION 5: VARICELLA (CHICKENPOX)
- SYMPTOMS: An itchy, blister-like rash. Begins with small red spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) before scabbing over. Often accompanied by fever and fatigue.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Colloidal oatmeal baths and Calamine lotion. Use Acetaminophen for fever. 
- FOODS TO AVOID: Salty, spicy, or acidic foods if blisters are in the mouth.
- LIFESTYLE TO AVOID: Avoid public spaces until every blister has scabbed.
- ROUTINE TO AVOID: DO NOT SCRATCH. NEVER give Aspirin to children/teens (Reye’s Syndrome risk).

### CONDITION 6: CONTACT DERMATITIS (SKIN ALLERGIES)
- SYMPTOMS: A red, itchy, or stinging rash that appears exactly where the skin touched a substance. May include blisters, dry/cracked skin, or swelling.
- REMEDY & TREATMENT: Wash the area with mild soap immediately. Apply hydrocortisone or Calamine.
- FOODS TO AVOID: If metal-sensitive, limit high-nickel foods (chocolate, nuts).
- LIFESTYLE TO AVOID: Avoid outdoor brush (Poison Ivy/Oak) without protection.
- ROUTINE TO AVOID: Avoid new, untested products; always perform a 24-hour patch test.

VISUAL HAZARD DETECTION: INGREDIENT TRIGGERS
=========================================

### HAZARDS FOR ACNE (PIMPLES/BOILS)
- INGREDIENT: Isopropyl Myristate / Isopropyl Palmitate
  - HAZARD: Highly comedogenic (pore-clogging). Can turn a small pimple into a deep cyst.
- INGREDIENT: Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera)
  - HAZARD: Extremely heavy lipid that traps bacteria inside pores. 
- INGREDIENT: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)
  - HAZARD: Known to cause "follicular irritation," which can trigger new breakouts.

### HAZARDS FOR ECZEMA (ATOPIC DERMATITIS)
- INGREDIENT: Denatured Alcohol / Ethanol / SD Alcohol
  - HAZARD: Strips the moisture barrier instantly. Causes "flare-ups," stinging, and extreme dryness.
- INGREDIENT: Fragrance / Parfum / Linalool / Limonene
  - HAZARD: The #1 trigger for eczema-related allergic reactions. Causes redness and intense itching.
- INGREDIENT: Essential Oils (Lavender, Peppermint, Citrus)
  - HAZARD: Though "natural," these are highly volatile and often cause burning on compromised eczema skin.

### HAZARDS FOR HIVES & CONTACT DERMATITIS
- INGREDIENT: Methylisothiazolinone (Preservative)
  - HAZARD: A common "contact allergen." If detected, it is likely the cause of the user's hives or rash.
- INGREDIENT: Oxybenzone (Chemical Sunscreen)
  - HAZARD: Frequently causes "photo-allergic" reactions where the skin breaks into hives when exposed to sun.
- INGREDIENT: Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM Hydantoin)
  - HAZARD: High-risk trigger for localized swelling and itchy red welts.

### HAZARDS FOR CHICKENPOX
- INGREDIENT: Salicylic Acid / Glycolic Acid (Exfoliants)
  - HAZARD: Can cause chemical burns on open chickenpox blisters. 
- INGREDIENT: Retinol / Vitamin A
  - HAZARD: Too aggressive for viral lesions. Increases the risk of permanent scarring (pitting).
